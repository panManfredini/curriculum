\section{About Me}
\cvline{}{
My main expertise are in data intensive statistical analyses and the Internet of Things. 
For the last two years I was employed in the development/maintainance of the software stack for enviromental monitors in the field of radiation protection.
I have been professionally programming in C++, Python and JavaScript for more than six years. 
I am experienced with micro-service architecture design, Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. 
I have good knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases.
% I'm passionate about....
And when I've finished programming, I love to go rock climbing. }

\section{Software Engineer at Arktis}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{2021--Present}} {
\bul{\href{https://www.arktis-detectors.com}{Arktis}} is a company that designs innovative solutions for radiation detection.
The most common products are Radiation Portal Monitors, which are systems equipped with a variety of sensors (radiation detectors, lidar, camera, temperature, humidity) 
and an embedded PC for realtime data analysis.}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Software Stack:}}{Being a small company I've been developing and maintaining the entire software stack, 
from sensor readout and detecors calibration to event data analysis, web interface and user experience. My main responsability is to design
algorithms that efficiently identify in real-time the radioactive isotopes based on the recorded energy spectra.}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Machine Learning:}}{ I've been designing and training deep learning models (Keras/Tensorflow)
for spectral identification using radiation detectors data. I've also developed a neural-network that classifies road traffic conditions (in the vicinity of the sensors)
using camera images.}

\section{Research During Second Postdoc}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{2018--2021}} { I joined the group of Prof.~Laura~Baudis as co-leader of an ERC funded R\&D project for the future DARWIN dark matter detector
(\bul{\href{https://darwin.physik.uzh.ch/}{more info here}}). I was responsible for the design of a fully automated experiment monitoring and control system
based on industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and state of the art of big-data tools. I designed innovative IoT gateways (\bul{\href{https://opc-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html}{OPC-Proxy}} and \bul{\href{https://github.com/panManfredini/IOTpy}{IoTpy}}) that allows to connect  the data-taking sensors with the micro-services infrastructure of our back-end. 
We use Kubernetes to orchestrate a series of services that includes Prometheus, Grafana, NodeJs and Apache Kafka. Finally, I designed the graphical user interface of our system,
allowing to control the experiment remotely from a browser.}

\section{Research During First Postdoc}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{2014--2018}}{I joined the \bul{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENON}{XENON}} dark matter project in the group of Prof.~Ran~Budnik.
%	The \bul{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENON}{XENON project}} features deep underground experiments that aim to detect dark matter with a
%	liquid xenon Time Projection Chamber. 
	The XENON collaboration consist of more than 100 physicist from all over the world. 
%	My main contribution in XENON was to perform data analysis with particular focus on statistical inference of data,
%	furthermore, I also contributed to the development of the XENON1T slow control system.
	}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Statistics:}}{For two years I was co-leading the statistical inference team of the XENON1T experiment, where I performed 
hypothesis testing with computation of the confidence intervals and developed the statistical model of the experiment.}

%\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Data Analysis:}}{ I contributed with two independent Analyses. One performing dark matter search in the 
%framework of Effective Field Theory. The other investigating inelastic dark matter scattering on $^{129}$Xe isotope.}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Slow Control:}}{I was part of the XENON1T slow control developers team. My main contribution was to design the safety and motion control systems 
					for a set of motors and belts used to move calibration sources in the experiment. I also developed the high voltage module
					controller, and the safety system of the experiment's water recirculation facility.}


\section{Research During Ph.D.}
\cvline{}{I joined the \bul{\href{https://atlas.cern/}{ATLAS}} experiment at CERN in 2011 under the supervision of Dr.~Sandra Kortner.  
%	\bul{\href{https://atlas.cern/}{ATLAS}} is a general purpose particles detector and part of the Large Hadron Collider project. 
	The ATLAS collaboration consist of thousands of physicist all over the world.}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Thesis Title:}} {"Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons in  $A/h/H \rightarrow \tau^+\tau^- \rightarrow e\mu + 4\nu$ Decays with the ATLAS Detector." }

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Data Analysis}}{I was part of the ATLAS Beyond Standard Model Higgs sub-group. 
			I contributed to the neutral MSSM Higgs boson search of	which I was one of the main analyzer. 
			%This analysis  considered the Higgs decaying into taus and their subsequent decay in electron 
			%or muon. 
			My contribution was focused on the estimation of the backgrounds and their systematics, the  implementation of 
			the probability	model for hypothesis testing, and on studies aimed to improve the signal sensitivity at
			low mass employing flavor tagging techniques.}

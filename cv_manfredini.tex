		   \newline \emph{University of Roma Tre}, Rome, Italy. Grade: 110/110 magna cum laude.}

\section{Highlights}
\cvline{2016--2018}{XENON1T's statistical inference co-coordinator.} 
\cvline{2019 --}{DARWIN's electrodes and high voltage sub-group coordinator.} 
\cvline{2017}{Awarded \emph{"senior postdoctoral fellow"} at Weizmann Institute of Science.} 
\cvline{Since 2014}{Member of XENON1T's slow control developers team.} 
\cvline{2011--2014}{Data analyst in the ATLAS experiment.} 

\section{Second Postdoc}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{2018--Present}} { I joined the group of Prof.~Laura~Baudis as co-leader of an R\&D project for the future DARWIN dark matter detector.
DARWIN will be a 50\,tonne liquid-xenon time projection chamber. The aim of this project is to demonstrate electron drift in liquid-xenon above 2.6\,m. 
For this experiment, I am currently designing the field cage of the time projection chamber and a fully automated monitoring and control system. 
I was recently appointed coordinator of the DARWIN's electrodes and high voltage sub-group.}

\section{First Postdoc}
\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{2014--2018}}{I joined the XENON dark matter project in 2014 in the group of Prof.~Ran~Budnik.
	The XENON project features deep underground experiments that aim to detect dark matter with 
	a dual phase liquid xenon Time Projection Chamber. XENON1T is the most sensitive dark matter experiment to date. 
%	My main contribution in XENON was to perform data analysis with particular focus on statistical inference of data,
%	furthermore, I also contributed to the development of the XENON1T slow control system.
	}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Statistics:}}{For two years I was co-leading the statistical inference effort of the XENON1T experiment.
			I was part of a team that performed the statistical combination of the three science runs of the XENON100 experiment. 
			%Currently one of my main interests is the development of statistical methods particularly aimed for low rate experiments.
			}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Data Analysis:}}{ I contributed to two independent searches of the XENON100 experiment, being one of the main analyzers. One performing dark matter search in the 
	framework of Effective Field Theory. The other investigating inelastic dark matter scattering on $^{129}$Xe isotope.}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Slow Control:}}{I was part of the XENON1T slow control developers team. My main contribution was to design the safety and motion control systems 
					for a set of motors and belts used to move calibration sources in the experiment. I also developed the XENON1T PMTs high voltage module
					controller, and the safety system of the experiment's water recirculation facility.}


\section{Research during Ph.D.}
\cvline{}{I joined the ATLAS experiment in 2011 under the supervision of  Prof. Siegfried Bethke and Dr. Sandra Kortner.  
	ATLAS is a general purpose particles detector and part of the Large Hadron Collider project.}

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Thesis Title:}} {"Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons in  $A/h/H \rightarrow \tau^+\tau^- \rightarrow e\mu + 4\nu$ Decays with the ATLAS Detector." }

\cvline{\textcolor{color1}{Data Analysis}}{I was part of the ATLAS Beyond Standard Model Higgs sub-group. 
			I contributed to the neutral MSSM Higgs boson search of	which I was one of the main analyzer. 
			%This analysis  considered the Higgs decaying into taus and their subsequent decay in electron 
			%or muon. 
			My contribution was focused on the estimation of the backgrounds and their systematics, the  implementation of 
			the probability	model for hypothesis testing, and on studies aimed to improve the signal sensitivity at
			low mass employing flavor tagging techniques.
